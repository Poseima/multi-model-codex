### How to Retrieve Memories

If your current task matches any memory clues above, call the `memory_retrieve`
tool with a detailed query describing what context you need. The tool will
research your project memories and return synthesized findings with source
references.

Only retrieve memories when clues are relevant to your current task.
Do not retrieve memories for trivial or unrelated queries.
