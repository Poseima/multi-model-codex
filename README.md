## About This Fork

This is a fork of the official [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) that adds multi-provider model support through [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).

### Key Features Added

- **Multi provider Integration**: Use Codex with multiple AI providers including openrouter, minimax, z.ai
- **Provider Selection UI**: Switch between model providers using the `/provider` slash command in the TUI
- **Context Window Display**: View context window total tokens in the footer
- **Token Usage Tracking**: Monitor token consumption during sessions

This fork maintains full compatibility with upstream Codex while extending model provider flexibility for developers who need access to multiple AI models.

### Upstream

This repository tracks the official OpenAI Codex repository and periodically merges updates from upstream/main.

## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex CLI

Install globally with your preferred package manager:

```shell
# Install using npm
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

```shell
# Install using Homebrew
brew install --cask codex
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started.

<details>
<summary>You can also go to the <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest">latest GitHub Release</a> and download the appropriate binary for your platform.</summary>

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.
